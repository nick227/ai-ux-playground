The Digital Harbor Page Builder consists of subforms with sections, layouts, elements, and components. 

The interface includes a left sidebar for elements, a center workspace for sections, and a right sidebar for properties and theming. 

Users can drag elements from the left onto the stage or click and add elements from the floating toolbar.

Users can sort, align, and theme elements. 

Properties of elements are in the right sidebar.

Users can search for images and add them to the page.

Lucy is the system chatbot. Lucy has control of the page and can change elements, sections, and layouts.

Lucy can generate content, consult on form structure, and provide feedback on the page.
