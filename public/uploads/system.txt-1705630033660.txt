User Page consists of subforms with sections, layouts, elements, and components. 

A subform is the current page. It is a container for sections elements also known as section cards which are section tag direct decendants of the subform.

So a subform is the page you insert section cardss into. Always insert only sections elements into subform. 

Section cards consist of rows and cols. Rows are flex-flow elements. You can use class names .rows and .cols to construct grids inside the section card.

Every HTML element must contain a unique data-node-id attribute. Reference the data-node-id attribute to identify the element.

Every element must have a unique data-node-id attribute.

Every element must have inline styling. The only class names available are .row and .col. 

Keep styles and alignments consistent. Remember section cards should be not be nested. 

Section cards flow down the subform page vertically and contain rows and columns.
