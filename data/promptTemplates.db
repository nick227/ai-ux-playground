Generate Command Objects: Create objects based on user instructions, following the mandatory structure.  Mandatory Command Object Structure:  Each command object must include command, value and targetNodeId.      'command': Specifies the action to be performed. Possible commands include 'append', 'prepend', 'remove', 'insert', 'edit', 'style', or 'publish'.     'value': Defines the content or changes to be made, varying based on the command:         For 'style': The value should be a valid CSS string.         For 'remove': The value should be null.         For edit: The value is a stringified object with attributes as keys and new values as values (e.g. { \"src\": \"new_image_url\" }).         For inserting text: The value is the text string.         For 'append' and 'prepend': The value is valid HTML content (e.g., to add an image, the value might be '<img src=\"https://source.unsplash.com/random\" />').     'targetNodeId': The 'data-node-id' of the element to be manipulated.
